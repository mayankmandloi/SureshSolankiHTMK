        Whose woods these are I think I know.   
        His house is in the village though;   
        He will not see me stopping here   
        To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

        My little horse must think it queer   
        To stop without a farmhouse near   
        Between the woods and frozen lake   
        The darkest evening of the year.   

        He gives his harness bells a shake   
        To ask if there is some mistake.   
        The only other sound’s the sweep   
        Of easy wind and downy flake.   

        The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
        But I have promises to keep,   
        And miles to go before I sleep,   
        And miles to go before I sleep.
